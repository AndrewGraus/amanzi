Hi,

A plan for workaround the existing mesh bugs. Mesh MSTK will be used
as the starting point as this framework is rich in features.

1. Provide future sustainability and extensibility.
Details: 
  Create light-weighted constructors using a parameter list.
  Move body of current constructors to init() functions.
  This will allow us to add more options in the future via a parameter list.

  Order caches by global id.
  This will allow us to simplify current and future algorithms and to reduce 
  amount of coding.
Time: 16 hours

2. Implement topology and geometry functions using the delegation pattern.
  Most functions are ported directly. For instance, cell->faces will call face->edges. 
Time: 10 hours

3. Sets
  Requires more work, since sets are kept inside MSTK. However, data flow 
  is quite generic which helps. 
Time: 24 hours.

4. Mesh maps
  Requires to revisit MSTK algorithms. Potentially, taking a trace of 3D maps
  would be the most robust approach. For instance 2D cell_map() is build using 
  trace of 3D face_map().
Time: 32 hours

Total: 82 hours
