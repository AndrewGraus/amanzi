\section{Amanzi libraries}

This section describes Amanzi libraries, their limitations and possible 
ways to extend.

\subsection{WhetStone}
This is a low-level library that implements local matrices for various 
discretizations schemes. 
Conceptual desing of the library is presented in Fig.~\ref{whetstone}.

This library contains a factory of discretization scheme that could
be extended by including users schemes.
Example of such an extension is available.
